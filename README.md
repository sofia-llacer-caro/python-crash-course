This is a repository with the content covered in a crash course offered at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB). This was during the academic year 2023-2024 under the course "Research & Innovation" as part of the Modelling for Science and Engineering Master's Degree. Most of the code provided was written by Martín H. Campos, and I am only using it as an educational example.

I decided to create a GitHub repository because of two reasons:
1. I was using a temporary laptop at the time because mine was getting repaired and I wanted to have a way to access my work from any device.
2. I thought this would be a good oportunity to start getting familiar with GitHub.

The project includes a virtual environment as a test to see if I was able to create the requirements file and follow the standard procedure when coding something in python which is supposed to be useable by others. The collatz_conjecture folder does not need built-in packages to work, whereas the face-comparison does (as a test for both case-situations).
