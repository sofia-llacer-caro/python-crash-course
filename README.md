This is a repository with the content covered in a crash course offered at the Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona (UAB). This was during the academic year 2023-2024 under the course "Research & Innovation" as part of the Modelling for Science and Engineering Master's Degree.

I decided to create a GitHub repository because of two reasons:
1. I was using a temporary laptop at the time because mine was getting repaired and I wanted to have a way to access my work from any device.
2. I thought this would be a good oportunity to start getting familiar with GitHub.
